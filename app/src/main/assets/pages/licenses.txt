                    <p class="main-license">Poppins is a geometric sans serif font supporting Devanagari and Latin
                        scripts. Its Latin glyphs are rationalist, while the Devanagari design, introduced in 2015, was
                        pioneering, featuring various weights. Developed by Indian Type Foundry, Poppins maintains
                        monolinear letterforms with optical corrections. It later expanded to include multiple weights
                        and italics by the ITF studio team. </p>
